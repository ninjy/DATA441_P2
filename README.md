# DATA441_P2

This project adapts and modifies the class given code for Gramfort's version of Lowess to accommodate train and test sets with multidimensional features.
The function is then tested on real data (Cars and Concrete datasets from class) with k-Fold cross-validations.
To take it a step further, a SciKitLearn-compliant version of the function is written and tested with GridSearchCV from SciKitLearn.
